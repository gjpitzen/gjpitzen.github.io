	<h1> Video games </h1>
	
	<p> Ever since I was little I have loved playing video games. Whether it be alone or with friends, 
	I have always been entranced by many different kinds of games. When I was super young I loved to play 
	on the Wii and Wii-U, games on the sports resort were incredibly fun and super fun to play with friends.
	When I got a bit older I got my Xbox One, and played on that console for a few years, and I loved to play 
	games like the Madden or Forza series', or the Halo series. Once I downloaded Overwatch on my Xbox I grew a 
	huge liking for first person shooter games, and shortly after got a PC to play more of these types of games.
	After getting my PC when I was around 10 years old I really started to play games to be good rather than 
	for fun with friends. I managed to hit mid masters in Overwatch when I was 11 years old, a pretty challenging
	feat for someone so young. Around 2018 when fortnite began to gain steam I made the switch, playing mostly 
	for fun with friends as I wasnt very good when I first started. However as the game got a bit more developed 
	I started playing around with the competitive scene with some of my better friends I had made, and eventually
	managed to place top 100 in an online tournament in the North American region. Then the game Valorant released,
	a type of game completely new to me. Fornite and Overwatch were very fast paced games, but Valorant was slower
	and more tactical, which of course I needed to master. Within about a year of Valorant releasing I was able 
	to hit top 600 of all players in North America and ended the season in the top 1100.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Competing in Rivals, and Mobile Games </h2>
	
	<p> I never got too invested in playing tournaments in Valorant, but about a year ago in late 2024 a new game
	released that caught my attention. Marvel Rivals was a huge hit with the Marvel IP and a very similar style 
	to Overwatch. At first I didnt think I'd enjoy it very much, but after a week of playing I was hooked. In the 
	first season of the game I hit the top rank of Eternity, and was already within the top 1000 players.
    I began pushing ranked by myself and with friends, and ended up hitting top 200 One Above All, the rank for 
	the top 500 Eternity players in the world. I grouped up with some friends also in the top ranks and played 
	in the games Marvel Rivals Championship, an open tournament within the game. In our first MRC we managed to 
	place top 32 in North America without practicing at all. For the next season, we played again practicing 
	against other top teams before the tournament, and improving to an impressive top 16 finish, earning 200 dollars.
	I have also been playing mobile games for a very long time, mainly Clash of Clans. While I never tried to play 
	any tournaments in Clash, I have pushed the leaderboards in that game as well. Hitting rank 3 globally during 
	september season in 2024, before taking a break for a bit to focus on Rivlas and school.
