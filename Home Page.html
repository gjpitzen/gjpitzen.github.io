		 <h2> Some information about me. </h2>
		 
		 <p> I am a Junior undergrad at the University of Wisconsin Madison who transferred to the university this past summer.
		 I am pursuing a degree in Information Science and interested in a certificate in game design. I went to highschool here in 
		 Madison at James Madison Memorial Highschool, now known as Vel Phillips Memorial Highschool and graduated in 2023. 
		 I was apart of the swim team there, earning all american awards and a school record in the 50 yard freestyle. I have been 
		 swimming since I was 11 and swam for Madison Aquatic Club (MAC) year round until the end of my senior year. During my time
		 at MAC I earned 9 state championships and multiple club records, some of which I still hold. I now am on the club swim
		 team at UW, already breaking the clubs 50 yard freestyle record this fall. I have always been a huge sports fan not 
		 limited to just swimming, I am a New York Giants fan and general lover of football. I played football when I was younger 
		 but decided to follow the swimming path, but have been keeping up with football my whole life. I also love to play video 
		 games, mostly the FPS genre, like Valorant, Counter-Strike, Rainbow 6 Siege, Marvel Rivals, and more. I have always been 
		 competitive in these games, reaching top 600 in North America in valorant, top 200 globally in Marvel Rivals and placing 
		 top 16 in the MRC tournament in the NA region, and hitting global in Counter-Strike. I also love Formula 1, it is currently
		 my favorite sport to watch as the Giants suck. I am a big McLaren fan as it has been my favorite car brand nearly my whole
		 life. I love both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and just want one of them to win the WDC this year even though every week
		 I get a bit more nervous they will blow it to Max Verstappen yet again.
