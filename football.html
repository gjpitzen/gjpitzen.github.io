	<h1> Football </h1>
	
	<p> Football has been a huge part of my life especially when I was younger. Between the ages of about 4 and 9 I played
	flag football with my friends through play 360. I considered transitioning to tackle as well but decided to start swimming 
	instead. I have been a New York Giants fan my whole life, watching them win 2 Super Bowls when I was very young (really 
	only 1 as I was 2 years old when they won in 2007). Recently the Giants have been quite awful, but I have grown to appreciate
	good football as time has passed with the Giants downfall. When I was little I was a huge stat nerd, I knew every major 
	player and thei accolades and statistics from the season, I even kept track of records and how well each team was doing. 
	Now, each week I attempt to predict the scores and winner from each game to see how accurate I can be. I have been doing 
	this for 3 seasons now, and have been getting better as each season goes by.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Favorite Players </h2>
	
	<p> When I was younger I loved Eli Manning and Victor Cruz as they were some of the best players on the New York Giants at the time.
	Now I am a big fan of Josh Allen, the quarterback of the Bufallo Bills. However, new to the league this year, rookies Cam Skattebo
	and Jaxson Dart of the New York Giants have won me over. They are incredibly exciting players to watch and have an amazing attitude
	towards the game of football. Unfortunately in week 8 of the NFL season Cam Skattebo suffered a season-ending, gruesome ankle 
	dislocation against the rival Philadelphia Eagles. Even in the home stadium of the Eagles, Skattebo was given a standing ovation 
	as he was carted off the field as him and Dart have become fan favorites over the past few weeks for their exciting old school style
	of play. With this injury I am really hoping that Josh Allen may finally have his year to win the Super Bowl as the Chiefs who have
	stopped him time and time again are having a bit of a shaky start and are looking mightily inconsistent.
