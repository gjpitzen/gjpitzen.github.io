	<h1> Swimming and Achievements </h1>
	
	<p> Swimming has been a very important part of my life since I can remember. I was in swimming lessons early and always loved being in and around water.
	I began competitive swimming when I was 11 with the all city pool Seminole, and Madison Aquatic club. Within my first year I was already a member of MAC's
	state championship winning relay, and would remain a member until I finally stopped swimming with MAC when I was 18. My final year at all city I moved to 
	Goodman pool to swim with my MAC friends for one last summer before college. With Memorial during highschool I was awarded All-American awards for the 50 
	yard freestyle, the 200 yard Individual Medley, and the 100 yard butterfly. I finished in 4th place at the highschool division 1 state championships in 
	both the 200 yard IM and the 100 yard butterfly, and my 200 and 400 freestyle relays came 3rd and 4th respectively. As the starting member of the 200 
	freestyle relay I set the school record in the 50 yard freestyle, a time which would have also gotten me 4th place in the individual event. 
	</p>
	
	<h2> Coaching and Beyond Highschool </h2>
	
	<p> Since I have entered college I have been coaching the Memorial highschool preseason practices, and more recently in the latter half of 2025, been 
	training myself for UW club swimming. So far I have completed 2 meets for the UW club team winning all events but one to a good friend of mine on the team 
	as well. I have set the Swim Club UW (SCUW) in the 50 free, and look to add to the list of records by the end of the season in april. I am interested in 
	coaching as well. Whether it be for a club team, highschool team, or summer swim team, I am very interested in helping others improve their swimming.
	</p>
